# guessTheNumber

This project is a sample setup of React 16, Webpack 4, and Babel.
It also includes hotloading and basic linting, as well as a few (not exhaustive) tests.
It implements a simple number guessing game using React components.

This project does NOT:
- Check that inputs are numbers
- Check that the upper bound is higher than the lower bound
- Check whether the user already guessed a number
- Check whether the number guessed is within the range
- Reset after a winning guess
